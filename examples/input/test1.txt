**Lexique**
- *Laser scanner unit*: This component refers to the core device responsible for emitting laser beams and measuring the reflected signals to create a point cloud. It performs the primary function of LiDar data acquisition.
- *GPS (Global Positioning System)*: GPS provides precise location information, such as latitude and longitude, which can be used for georeferencing the LiDar data.
- *IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)*: IMU captures moton-related data, such as acceleration and rotation, which helps in determining the LiDar sensor's position and orientation. It aids in improving the accuracy of the LiDar data.
- *Collection vehicle*: This refers to the platform on which the LiDar system is mounted. It can be an aircraft, helicopter, vehicle, or tripod, depending on the application and requirements.
- *INS (Inertial Navigation System)*: INS combines data from IMU and other sensors to estimate the LiDar system's position, velocity, and attitude. It provides more accurate and robust navigation information.
