In python, [pdf2docx](https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/pdf2docx) is the recommanded if not the on of the only packages that do pdf to docx

With a pdf file followed from [their repo](https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/pdf2docx/blob/master/test/samples/demo-table.pdf), we can test their module

Run for exxample
```bash
opencf examples/input/demo-table.pdf -o demo-table.docx
```

The command will use `pdf2docx` to save the pdf in the output path
